# Simple web application with Fetch API
This is a simple web application that I've developed to learn how to utilize Fetch API. It uses the web service from [this earlier project](https://github.com/sawa2005/course-rest-api) and it lets you create, read, update and delete courses from a database via the website.
These courses are courses I've completed in my education at the time of development.

The published web service can be found from this link: http://samuelwarduppgifter.one/rest/index.html
